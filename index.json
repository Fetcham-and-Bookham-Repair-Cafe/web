The Repair Café was started by members of Bookham and Horsley Rotary Club along with St. Mary’s Church and a team of local volunteers all with the goal of living more sustainably and helping the environment by repairing items and reducing land fill.\nWhy are we running the Café? Lots of items get thrown away sometimes with almost nothing wrong with them which could easily be repaired with just a little bit of know-how. Our team of volunteers can share their knowledge and offer you help and advice on how the item can be repaired, reused or recycled.\nWhen? The repair café meets on the first Saturday of every month at St. Mary’s Church Hall in Fetcham.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"76887015496b6bc3e7f2107145ecc1f8","permalink":"/author/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/","section":"authors","summary":"Thank you for visiting the Fetcham and Bookham Repair Café Website\nThe aim of our Repair Café is to: Reduce landfill waste by repairing broken items Sharing knowledge and skills Creating a social space where people can meet Who are we?","tags":null,"title":"","type":"authors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our repair café is an event usually lasting 2.5 hours on the first Saturday of the month where you can bring broken possessions to be fixed by volunteer repairers. You stay with the repairer while the work is being done so that you can see the work being carried out and maybe help yourself. One of the goals is that everyone will one day be able to repair their own items.\nThere is no charge, but donations are welcome to help cover costs.\nThe repair café helps to promote learning new skills and to save waste by less items being dispose off in landfill. The first repair café was started by Martine Postma in Amsterdam in 2009 and its great success led to the Repair Café Foundation being established. The Foundation provides advice and help in setting up and maintaining repair cafes and also supports campaigns such as the \u0026ldquo;Right to Repair\u0026rdquo; laws requiring manufacturers to make it easy to repair their products and to provide spare parts for at least 10 years.\nThere are over 2500 repair cafés worldwide with 278 in the UK and the number is growing fast all the time.
